#### History

The word Flay was derived from a character in Mervyn Peake's Gormanghast books. The manservant Flay was also played by Christopher Lee in a BBC miniseries of the books. Worth a watch.

Flay.Com has been a few things over the years:

-  A showcase site for artwork
-  A CG news and resources site
-  A WordPress blog
-  A photo gallery

Plan is to incorporate a bit of each above as a way of learning the "new" (to me) web technology.
