I'm good. Miss all the people, even (especially) those I graze by every day. 

It's somewhat dumbfounding what social connections you can feel just from waving to somebody you see at gigs. Or having thirty second of witless banter while ordering a coffee. Or chatting with the crust punks playing music on the drive. 

After years of weaning my social media down to a trickle, now it seems I need to reverse course and ramp it up to stave off the lonely.

Come friend me on Facebook if you like (I know I would):
