This will be a list of commercial software and available or reccommended open source (free as in "freedom") software that may perform the same function for you. Your mileage may vary depending on need, but each package often suffices for many users:

Adobe Photoshop = Krita and/or Gimp
Adobe Illustrator = Inkscape
Adobe Lightroom = Darktable
