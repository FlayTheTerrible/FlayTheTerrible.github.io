This is a list of available and reccommended open source (free as in "freedom") software that performs well on multiple platforms (MacOS, Windows and Linux). Your mileage may vary depending on need, but each package often suffices for most uses:

- paint = [Krita](https://krita.org/ "Krita - Digital Painting"),   [Mypaint](https://mypaint.org/ "MyPaint ")
- image manipulation = [Gimp](https://gimp.org/) 
- vector drawing = [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) 
- photo grading and light-table = [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) 
- 3D Graphics = [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 
- "Office Suite" = [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) 
- Video Editing = [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) 
- Web Browsing = [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
